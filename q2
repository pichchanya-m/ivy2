Of course. Using the CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer) algorithm is an excellent and standard method for calculating sine and cosine on an FPGA because it avoids complex multipliers, relying instead on simple bit-shifts, additions, and subtractions.

Here’s how you can integrate the CORDIC algorithm into your design to calculate the W coefficients.

Step-by-Step Implementation Plan ⚙️
1. Calculate Sine and Cosine of Input Angles
Your primary inputs are the angles 

a_i and b_i. You need to calculate 


sin(a_i), cos(a_i), sin(b_i), and cos(b_i).

You can do this using two CORDIC modules configured in "Rotation Mode."

Input: The angle (a_i or b_i), converted to a fixed-point format.

Process: The CORDIC rotator takes an initial vector (e.g., [1, 0]) and rotates it by the input angle.

Output: The final vector coordinates will be [cos(angle), sin(angle)].

So, you'll perform:

[cos(a_i), sin(a_i)] = CORDIC(a_i)

[cos(b_i), sin(b_i)] = CORDIC(b_i)

2. Calculate the Phase Argument
Next, use the sine and cosine values from Step 1 to calculate the phase argument inside the exponential. Let's call it P:

P=n⋅sin(a 
i
​
 )⋅cos(b 
i
​
 )+m⋅cos(a 
i
​
 )⋅sin(b 
i
​
 )
This step uses standard hardware multipliers and adders to combine the CORDIC outputs with the integer indices 

n and m.

3. Calculate the Final Complex Exponential
The final W coefficient is exp(-j * \pi * P). This is equivalent to:

W 
i,j
​
 =cos(−π⋅P)+j⋅sin(−π⋅P)

Which simplifies to:

W 
i,j
​
 =cos(π⋅P)−j⋅sin(π⋅P)

You can use a third CORDIC module for this final calculation.

Input: The calculated phase, phi = \pi * P.

Process: Use the CORDIC rotator again.

Output: The CORDIC module will output [cos(phi), sin(phi)], which are the real and imaginary parts of your W coefficient (with the sign adjusted for the imaginary part).

Design Choice: Pre-Calculation vs. Real-Time
The most important design decision is when to perform this calculation.

Recommended: Pre-calculation and Storage
Since the angles a_i and b_i are likely configuration parameters that don't change during operation, the entire W matrix is constant. The most efficient approach is to:

Calculate all 256 W_i,j values once during an initialization phase (or even offline in MATLAB before synthesis).

Store these pre-calculated complex coefficients in the FPGA’s internal memory (Block RAM or Look-Up Tables).

Your main processing logic then simply reads the required W coefficients from memory for the matrix multiplication.

This approach completely removes the need for any real-time CORDIC or multiplier logic in your main data path, making your design much faster and more resource-efficient.

Real-Time Calculation
You would only implement the CORDIC modules in the live data path if the angles a_i and b_i change dynamically during operation. This is less common and results in a more complex and resource-intensive design.

Example MATLAB Code (for HDL Coder)
When preparing your code for HDL generation, you can use MATLAB's built-in CORDIC functions, which are synthesizable. Here is a conceptual function showing the logic for calculating a single W coefficient.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
function W_ij = calculate_W_with_cordic(a_i, b_i, n, m)
    % Define fixed-point properties for CORDIC operations
    fi_p_props = numerictype('WordLength', 16, 'FractionLength', 14);
    
    % Step 1: Calculate sin/cos of input angles a_i and b_i
    % The CORDIC function can compute both sine and cosine simultaneously
    [sin_a, cos_a] = cordiccexp(0, a_i, 'InputFormat', 'radians'); 
    [sin_b, cos_b] = cordiccexp(0, b_i, 'InputFormat', 'radians');

    % Step 2: Calculate the phase argument P
    % Ensure n and m are cast to the fixed-point type for multiplication
    P = fi(n, fi_p_props) * sin_a * cos_b + fi(m, fi_p_props) * cos_a * sin_b;

    % Step 3: Calculate the final complex exponential using CORDIC
    % Input phase is phi = -pi * P
    phi = -pi * P;
    
    % cordiccexp calculates exp(j*phi) = cos(phi) + j*sin(phi)
    W_ij = cordiccexp(0, phi, 'InputFormat', 'radians');
